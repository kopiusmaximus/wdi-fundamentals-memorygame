<h1>Concentration</h1>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
<p> If you flip over a matching pair, the cards stay face-up. But if your cards are mismatched, they are turned face-down again. Did you just flip over a queen? Where do you remember seeing another queen? Ready...set...CONCENTRATE!</p>
